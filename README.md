# mywebsite
Learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript by building out my website. Started Feb 2021. 

Doing a lot of Googling. 

Also referring to the [Lambda School](https://lambdaschool.com/) Training Kit often. I work there in a non-technical role, and am doing this because I want to better understand the amazing graduates I get to work with! 

As I build a simple website, slowly and probably rather badly, I am routinely amazed by what people can create with code. This stuff is hard. :sweat_smile:
