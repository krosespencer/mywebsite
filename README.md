# mywebsite
Learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript by building out my website. 
Lot's of Googling. 
Also referring to Lambda School's Training Kit often (I work there in a non-technical role, but I wanted to better understand the amazing graduates I get to work with!) 
As I build a simple website, slowly and probably rather badly, I am routinely re-amazed by what people can build -- this stuff is hard.
